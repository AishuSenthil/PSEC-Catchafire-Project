# PSEC-Catchafire-Project
**PSEC STEM  - August 2023**

Designed an engaging Tableau dashboard for the Philadelphia STEM Equity Collective (PSEC), showcasing dynamic data visualizations that highlight significant opportunities within Philadelphia's communities and schools. Through my volunteer effort, PSEC benefitted a cost saving of $7069. 
Crafted an immersive dashboard featuring a geographical chart and location-specific demographic insights for the chosen zip code. The dashboard encompasses a comprehensive range of information, such as a curated list of schools, population breakdown by ethnic groups, poverty percentage comparisons between the city and the zip code, and a compilation of schools actively seeking support in the STEM education domain.
